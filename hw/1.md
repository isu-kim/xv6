## Overview

This project will help you understand the page table implementation in xv6. You will modify the code to improve memory usage by implementing page table sharing for kernel memory regions.

In xv6, every process has a page directory and a page table. The page table provides mapping information for the memory region used by the process, including the kernel region. Currently, each process has its own page table that maps the physical memory of the kernel to the virtual memory area (2 GB to 4 GB).

Since the mapping information for the kernel area is identical for all processes, it's unnecessary for each process to have its own copy. From a memory usage perspective, it would be advantageous to modify the code so that all processes share one page table for the kernel region.

## Part One: fork()

To enable all processes to share the page table for the kernel area, you need to understand the code that creates the page table mapping for the kernel area. In xv6, when creating a new process, it allocates a page table for the kernel area and stores the mapping information.

Modify the `fork()` function which creates a child process by copying the parent's memory area:

- **Hint 1:** The `copyuvm()` function in vm.c copies the page table of the parent. This function calls `setupkvm()` to generate mapping information for the kernel area. Instead of using `setupkvm()`, add code that copies the page directory entry of the parent. You should only allocate memory for page directories, not page tables.

- **Hint 2:** Modify the `freevm()` function in vm.c, which deallocates the process's page table. Currently, this function deallocates all page tables pointed to by the page directory. After your modifications to `copyuvm()`, the page tables for the kernel area should not be deallocated.

## Part Two: exec()

Modify the `exec()` function in exec.c. This function loads a program from disk into the memory of the current process and executes it. Because this function changes the code and data of the process, a new page table is created.

The `exec()` function also uses `setupkvm()` to generate mapping information for the kernel area. Instead of using this function, modify the code to copy and save the existing page directory entries.

## Submission Requirements

Submit the following modified files:
1. `vm.c` with modified `copyuvm()` and `freevm()` functions
2. `exec.c` with modified `exec()` function
